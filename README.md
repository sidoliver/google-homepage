#Google Homepage

## I have created the google.com homepage using HTML and CSS.

### Through out this project I have faced some challenges as I was not clear about some concept.Those are:
1. How to use flex-box to align items vertically and horizontally.
2. How to create a nav bar and align them horizontally.
3. How to align items using css position property.

  ## Now by building this project I learned: 
  * How to align nav links along with images and button in nav bar.
  * I learned to position my foooter links using flex box property. which was quite easy as compared to position property.
  ## These are the essential skills to build this project.
  #### These skills will be helpful for you when you start building. Either try them yourself or at least make sure you know how to do it:

* Two ways to move a div around on the page
* Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
* Identify the background color of an existing webpage
* Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
* Center an element horizontally
* Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
* Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
* Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
